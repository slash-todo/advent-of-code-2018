# advent-of-code-2018

## Introduction

A place for members to track their advent of code solutions to puzzles on [Advent of Code 2018](http://https://adventofcode.com/2018).

## Folder Structure

Top level of this project houses folders named for the dates puzzles were released. Inside each folder, a member submits a file with their name as the file name, and an extension they choose to work in.

If your solution has a complexity such that it requires multiple files, please add a folder with your name on it, within which is your work space.

i.e.

```sh
# Single File
advent-of-code/14/skat.js

# Folder
advent-of-code/14/skat/**/*
```
